## Features

- Downloads SCVI models based on organism and census version.
- Processes query datasets using SCVI models.
- Pulls reference datasets from CellxGene census data given an oranism and colletion name.
- Performs cell type classification of query datasets using a random forest model.
- Saves runtime parameters and outputs in a specified directory.

## Requirements

- **Nextflow** (>= 20.10.0)
- **Conda** (for environment management)
- My own conda environments are currently hard-coded into the pipeline (I will set up singularity environments in the future)
